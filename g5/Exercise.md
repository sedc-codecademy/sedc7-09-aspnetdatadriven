## An academy app
Create an academy web application. The application should have 3 screens:
* Home Screen - Has Welcome section
* Students Screen - Shows All Students with their projects
* Add Student - Screen with form to add new student ( without projects )

The screens should be navigated by a navigation bar which will be part of a template. The data for the students should be kept in an SQL Database. In the database there should be:
* Student
	* First Name
	* Last Name
	* Age
	* Academy ( Code, Design or Network )
	* Projects
* Project
	* Title
	* Estimated Time
	* Time Spent
	* Student

### Bonus
* In list all students page, list students without projects. Implement Details functionality so that a person can click on a button on every student and get a details view for that student with their projects.
* In the Details for student add an option: Add a project ( from where there can be a project added for that particular student )
